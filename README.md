# A Comparative Experimental Study of Static and Interactive Maps in Visualizing Travel Experience Using Public Transportation 
The project investigates how different map visualizations (static using QGIS vs interactive using D3.js and React) affect accuracy and user experience in representing public transport travel data.



## Interactive Map.
This repository holds the code for my master's thesis, the interactive maps only.
